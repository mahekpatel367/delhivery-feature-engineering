# Delhivery Feature Engineering Case Study

## Project Overview
This project focuses on feature engineering and data preprocessing using Delhivery logistics data to prepare a clean, modeling-ready dataset.

The engineered features aim to support delivery time prediction and operational performance analysis.

## Business Objective
- Clean and preprocess raw logistics data
- Engineer meaningful features for modeling
- Improve data quality for predictive analysis
- Support operational insights in logistics

## Dataset
The dataset includes logistics information such as:
- Shipment and delivery timestamps
- Distance and route details
- Location and hub information
- Status indicators

## Feature Engineering Steps
- Datetime feature extraction
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Distance and time-based feature creation
- Outlier treatment

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Datetime utilities
